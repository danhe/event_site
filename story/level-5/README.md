## Level 5

We did it Series A! After the celebration the product folks have started to get serious about their features.

Apparently people have been missing their events, we really need a system to notify by email about their events.

* Visitors and Users should be sent a notification when they sign up for an event
* Visitors and Users should be sent a notification a day before their event
* Visitors and Users should be sent a thank you message an hour after the event ends

Now might be a time to tidy up and refactor a bit.
