## Level 3

We are a victim of our own success ! We can't keep up with event creation from the general public, plus I am not sure we want to host events for PHP developers.

We now need close the platform down a bit.

* Only registered users can create events
* Only registered users can see events
* Only the admin user can invite registered users
* Registered users are sent a magic link to login and authenticate
