## Level 1

A visitor to the site can create events.  And choose:

* The event type (workshop / office_hours)
* A user that will be the speaker
* A date for the event (ex. 14th July 2018)
* A duration for the event (ex. between 09h00 and 10h00)
* A name for the event
* A location for the event
* A description of the event
* A maximum number of participants (workshop)

Workshops and office hours will have different strategies for the people who can attend; make sure this is reflected in the creation of the event and the attributes for each type of event
