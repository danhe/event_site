## Level 4

Whoops we made a strategic error!  As it turns out the people creating events aren't the same ones who attend (who knew! The product people really should have done some customer interviews!! Live and learn )

* Visitors to the app can see events
* Visitors and Users to the app can add / remove themselves as participants to events
* On the search page, visitors should have some indication of the remaining places for an event.
