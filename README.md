# Intro

We are building an event reservation application. For now we are building the simplest possible thing that can work.

There are two types of events:

* A Workshop, where during a time frame multiple people can attend (in parallel)
* An Office Hour, where during a time frame individual people can attend (in serial)

Events are not multi-day and can occur anytime in a 24hr day.

## Notes

Once you receive this bundle:
- init the git repository in the root directory `.`
- implement your solution in the `solution` directory following the tasks described in `level1`, `level2`, etc.
- manage feature as git feature branches, e.g. `features/level1`, `features/level2`, etc
- at the end of each feature, merge your code in `develop` branch
- at the end of your work, push the code in a remote origin and provide us the link or make a .zip file of your local work (including the .git directory) and send it us via email.

Good luck with it and enjoy the process! ;)
